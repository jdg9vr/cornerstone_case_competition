Winning Submission for the 2020 Cornerstone Research Case Competition

# Case Competition
My teammate, Max Pilloff, and I were tasked with evaluating a proposed merger of two fictional companies in the healthcare diagnosticas industry. From our analyses, we recommended to the FTC that the firms should not be allowed to merge. Our final report, presentation to Cornerstone Research evaluators, and code can be found in this repository.
